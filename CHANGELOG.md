More bug fixing

* Attempted a fix for Amberblast and merchant Call softlocking the game when played.
* Added a status effect icon for Refracting Light, and fixed the icons for Crimson Tears and Freezing Beauty

## 0.1.2

Bug Fixing:

* One Man's Trash now properly works without softlocking the game.
* Byakuren, Enlightened Magician should now have a text box
* Fixed a small localization error on Stored Wealth
* Gemstones now have a new keyword instead of limited: Unstable X. Localization of this keyword may be slightly borked, but if it works as intended, it will allow Gemstones to be played a limited number of times before being exiled. This is to allow Gemstones to naturally synergize with abilities and cards that trigger an effect when a gemstone is exiled.

## 0.1.1

Gemstone cards should now properly function as cards with limited uses.
